# Internet Printing Protocol \(IPP\)

The **Internet Printing Protocol (IPP)**, as specified in **RFC2910** and **RFC2911**, serves as a foundation for printing over the internet. Its capability to be extended is showcased by developments like **IPP Everywhere**, which aims to standardize mobile and cloud printing, and the introduction of extensions for **3D printing**.

Leveraging the **HTTP** protocol, IPP benefits from established security practices including **basic/digest authentication** and **SSL/TLS encryption**. Actions like submitting a print job or querying printer status are performed through **HTTP POST requests** directed at the IPP server, which operates on **port 631/tcp**.

A well-known implementation of IPP is **CUPS**, an open-source printing system prevalent across various Linux distributions and OS X. Despite its utility, IPP, akin to LPD, can be exploited to transmit malicious content through **PostScript** or **PJL files**, highlighting a potential security risk.

```python
# Example of sending an IPP request using Python
import requests

url = "http://printer.example.com:631/ipp/print"
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/ipp"}
data = b"..."  # IPP request data goes here

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data, verify=True)
print(response.status_code)
```
