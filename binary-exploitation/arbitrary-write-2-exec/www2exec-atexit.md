## **\_\_atexit Structures**

{% hint style="danger" %}
Nowadays is very **weird to exploit this!**
{% endhint %}

**`atexit()`** is a function to which **other functions are passed as parameters.** These **functions** will be **executed** when executing an **`exit()`** or the **return** of the **main**.\
If you can **modify** the **address** of any of these **functions** to point to a shellcode for example, you will **gain control** of the **process**, but this is currently more complicated.\
Currently the **addresses to the functions** to be executed are **hidden** behind several structures and finally the address to which it points are not the addresses of the functions, but are **encrypted with XOR** and displacements with a **random key**. So currently this attack vector is **not very useful at least on x86** and **x64\_86**.\
The **encryption function** is **`PTR_MANGLE`**. **Other architectures** such as m68k, mips32, mips64, aarch64, arm, hppa... **do not implement the encryption** function because it **returns the same** as it received as input. So these architectures would be attackable by this vector.

You can find an in depth explanation on how this works in [https://m101.github.io/binholic/2017/05/20/notes-on-abusing-exit-handlers.html](https://m101.github.io/binholic/2017/05/20/notes-on-abusing-exit-handlers.html)
