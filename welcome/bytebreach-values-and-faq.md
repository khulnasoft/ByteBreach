## ByteBreach faq

{% hint style="success" %}
* **Thank you so much for these resources, how can I thank you?**
{% endhint %}

You can publicly thanks ByteBreach teams for putting together all these resources publicly in a tweet mentioning [**@bytebreach\_live**](https://twitter.com/bytebreach\_live).\
If you are specially grateful you can also [**sponsor the project here**](https://github.com/sponsors/khulnasoft).\
And don't forget to **give a star in the Github projects!** (Find the links below).

{% endhint %}

You can **share new tips and tricks with the community or fix bugs** you find in the books sending a **Pull Request** to the respective Github pages:

* [https://github.com/khulnasoft/bytebreach](https://github.com/khulnasoft/bytebreach)

Don't forget to **give a star in the Github projects!**

{% hint style="success" %}
* **Can I copy some content from ByteBreach and put it in my blog?**
{% endhint %}

Yes, you can, but **don't forget to mention the specific link(s)** where the content was taken from.

{% hint style="success" %}
* **How can I cite a page of ByteBreach?**
{% endhint %}

As long as the link **of** the page(s) were you took the information from appears it's enough.\
If you need a bibtex you can use something like:

```latex
@misc{bytebreach-bibtexing,
  author = {"ByteBreach Team" or the Authors name of the specific page/trick},
  title = {Title of the Specific Page},
  year = {Year of Last Update (check it at the end of the page)},
  url = {\url{khulnasoft.github.io/bytebreach/specific-page}},
}
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
* **Can I copy all ByteBreach in my blog?**
{% endhint %}

**I would rather not**. Thats **not going to benefit anyone** as all the **content is already publicly available** in the official ByteBreach books for free.

If you fear that it will disappear, just fork it in Github or download it, as I said it's already free.

{% hint style="warning" %}
* **Why do you have sponsors? Are ByteBreach books for commercial purposes?**
{% endhint %}

The first **ByteBreach** **value** is to offer **FREE** hacking educational resources to **ALL** the world. The ByteBreach team has **dedicated thousands of hours** to offer this content, again, for **FREE**.

If you think ByteBreach books are made for **commercial purposes** you are **COMPLETELY WRONG**.

We have sponsors because, even if all the content is FREE, we want to **offer the community the possibility of appreciating our work** if they want to. Therefore, we offer people the option to donate to ByteBreach via [**Github sponsors**](https://github.com/sponsors/khulnasoft), and **relevant cybersecurity companies** to sponsor ByteBreach and to **have some ads** in the book being the **ads** always placed in places where make them **visible** but **doesn't disturb the learning** process if someone focus in the content.

You won't find ByteBreach filled with annoying ads like other blogs with much less content than ByteBreach, because ByteBreach is not made for commercial purposes.

{% hint style="danger" %}
* **What should I do if some ByteBreach page is based on my blog post but it isn't referenced?**
{% endhint %}

**We are very sorry. This shouldn't have happened**. Please, let us know via Github issues, Twitter, Discord... the link of the ByteBreach page with the content and the link of your blog and **we will check it and add it ASAP**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
* **What should I do if there is content from my blog in ByteBreach and I don't want it there?**
{% endhint %}

Note that having links to your page in ByteBreach:

* Improve your **SEO**
* The content gets **translated to more than 15 languages** making possible for more people to access this content
* **ByteBreach encourages** people to **check your page** (several people has mentioned us that since some page of them is in ByteBreach they receive more visits)

However, If you still want the content of your blog to be removed from ByteBreach just let us know and we will definitely **remove every link to your blog**, and any content based on it.

{% hint style="danger" %}
* **What should I do if I find copy-pasted content in ByteBreach?**
{% endhint %}

We always **give the original authors all the credits**. If you find a page with copy-pasted content without original source referenced, let us know and we will either **remove it**, **add the link before the text**, or **rewrite it adding the link**.
